Active Directory Group Policy Hierarchy,"In AD, group policies are processed according to hierarchy (LSDOU)<br><b>L - Local Policy</b>: FIRST policy that it processes, every higher policy override settings at this level.<br><b>S - Site Policy</b>: Less often used. To group settings by location (e.g. SG, Europe, etc.)<br><b>D - Domain Policy</b>: To deploy GPOs to all users/computers of a domain.<br><b>OU - Organizational Unit</b>: FINAL policy processed. OVERRIDES all other lower settings. Linking to an OU is preferred method to deploy GPOs. Different OUs can be created for different teams/departments."
Basic NTFS permissions,"Full Control, Modify, Read & execute, Read, Write, Special permissions"
Central Processing Unit (CPU),"Central Processing Unit (CPU) consists of 3 basic components:<br><ul><li><b>CPU Register</b> - A special, high-speed storage area within the CPU, holds instructions, storage address, or any kind of data.</li><li><b>Arithmetic-logic unit (ALU)</b> - Does artithmetic and logical operations.</li><li><b>Control Unit</b> - Tells the ALU what operation to perform on the data found in the input register, as well as to store the computed result in an output register. Moves the data between input, output register, ALU, and memory</li></ul>"
Clock Speed,"Also referred as clock rate, CPU frequency.<br><br>More on frequency:<ul><li>Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating cycle per unit time</li><li>Frequency is measured in Hertz(Hz)</li><li>The repeating event is known as a period</li></ul><br>Analogy: If a computer is a car, then the CPU is the engine. The higher the clock speed, the faster the car will be."
CPU Cache,"<ul><li>CPU Cache is a small and fast memory used by CPU to reduce time to access data from the main memory, another name for main memory is Random-Access Memory (RAM). It stores copies of frequently used data.</li><li>When processor needs data, it first checks whether a copy of that data is in the cache (faster to get from cache than RAM)</li><li>L1, L2 cache owned by each core, L3 cache shared by all cores</li><li>A large cache can increase computer performance in general but there are other considerations: read latency (time to search for content), cache coherency (consistency in content between RAM and cache)</li></ul>"
CPU Speed Calculation,"<ul><li>CPU Speed is the number of calculations/ instructions it can process in one second (depends on clock speed and cores and cache).</li><li>For example, a dual core 3.0 GHz processor would be capable of running faster than a single core 3.0 GHz processor. Although both have the same clock speed, but the dual core processor can perform more calculations as it has two cores.<li></ul><br><b>Calculation Example</b><br><img src='data/images/C228_CPU_Calc.jpg'>"

Microsoft Patch Tuesday,Regular patches from Microsoft on the second Tuesday of each month. Worldwide roll-out from Tue 10:00am PST (but not sent out all at once to every computer in the world. Will take a few hours for updates to roll out across the world)
Paging,"For Paging Terminology, see Which statement is true/false for paging?<br><b>Page fault </b> - Page not found in RAM<br>Actions to be taken in a page fault:<ol><li>Find page on disk</li><li>Find empty page frame in RAM</li><li>Transfer page from disk to empty page frame</li><li>Update page table</li><li>Retry instruction which caused page fault, return control to running process</li></ol><br><b>Replacement Policy</b> takes place when deciding which page to be replaced when there is no free page frame. E.g. First In First Out (FIFO)"
Pagefile.sys in Windows,"<ul><li><b>Pagefile.sys</b> is used when there is insufficient RAM to run a program, Windows moves data from RAM to a page file to free RAM</li><li>Windows memory manager is always using pagefile.sys, hence it cannot be deleted unless the page file feature is disabled</li><li>pagefile.sys defaults:<ul><li>In root folder on same drive as Windows system files (e.g. C:\)</li><li>Size changes and depends on how much RAM installed<ul><li>Minimum - 1.5 x RAM for RAM <1GB, 1 x RAM otherwise</li><li>Maximum - 3 x RAM</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>"
Policy Refresh,"Workstations, Member Servers: Every 90min, with a random offset interval up to 30 min.<br>Domain Controllers (DC): Every 5 min"
Principle of Least Privilege (POLP),Minimal level of access that allows normal functioning. Give the lowest level of rights with which users can still do their jobs. Limits potential damage of security breach.
Problems with Patches,"The day after Patch Tuesday, hackers will swoop in with new zero-day exploits. Hackers can also reverse-engineer patches to create new exploits in a matter of days or even hours. Hackers also have an entire month between Patch Tuesdays to exploit the vulnerability."
sc command,"Usage: sc start/stop ""<service name>"" (e.g. sc start ""FileZilla Server"") sc commands use asynchronous mode, which does not wait for the operation to complete before returning control to the user. Could be more efficient if next operation does not depend on the service status."
Security concern with Virtualization,Misconfigured VM due to necessary services are stopped.
Services (Characteristics),"Advanced feature of MS Windows (known earlier as NT services), support mgmnt of long running/background processes and applications (similar to UNIX daemons), can start before any user logs on, ideal for software that needs to start at machine boot (e.g. web/database/app servers), can continue running even after all users log off"
Services (Purpose),"Provide core OS functions like event logging, file serving, printing, time synchronization, etc."
Service Administration,Use net and sc commands (see net command and sc command for more info)
Service Control Manager (SCM),"Service control programs communicate with the Service Control Manager (SCM), which is a special process that starts at sys boot. It starts, stops and interacts with Windows service processes. Located at C:\Windows\System32\services.exe"
Service Control Manager (SCM) purposes,"Maintains/locks/unlocks service database, tracks stats. of installed services, starts services/driver services on sys. startup/upon demand, transmit control requests to running services."
Service Hardening Methods / LSA Alternatives,"<b><u>Local and Network Service</b></u><br>Microsoft has provided 2 additional SIDs for Local Administrators to assign to services:<br><ul><li>Local Service (SID: S-1-5-19) - For services that only access local resources & don't need access to network resources. Actual name: NT AUTHORITY\LocalService.</li><li>Network Service (SID: S-1-5-20) - For services that need access to network resources, accesses network resources using the computer's credentials - similar to LSA. Actual name: NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService. Both Local Service and Network Service don't have a password like LSA.</li></ul><br><b><u>Domain Service Account/Managed Service Account/Virtual Account</b></u><br>Besides Local and Network Service, Windows supports alternative approaches to assigning service accounts with restricted privileges.<br><ul><li>Domain Service Account - Able to centrally manage as a domain account in AD, able to assign specific perms, needs manual/custom password management.</li><li>Managed Service Account - Needs Windows PowerShell to setup, no GUI support for creating and managing MSAs, password auto created for MSA when account is created, refreshed every 30 days. Password can also be changed manually.</li><li>Virtual Account - Need to use sc command to setup, virtual account name is NT SERVICE\<servicename>, automatically generated 240-byte, random password, non-expiring account and cannot be locked out, service logs on as virtual account with same service name, makes auditing easier.</li></ul>"
Service Startup Options,"Automatic: Service starts automatically as part of Windows boot process; Automatic (Delayed Start): Services starts automatically with a delay, to let other services with Automatic start execute first; Manual: Service is off by default but can be started by another app or process that needs it. Once started, will remain on until manually stopped or system reboots. Disabled: Service will not start and cannot be started unless setting is changed."
Service Testing,Unit testing > System Integration Testing (SIT) > On-Site Acceptance Testing (OSAT) > User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
