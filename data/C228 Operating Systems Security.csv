Active Directory Group Policy Hierarchy,"In AD, group policies are processed according to hierarchy (LSDOU)<br><b>L – Local Policy</b>: FIRST policy that it processes, every higher policy override settings at this level.<br><b>S – Site Policy</b>: Less often used. To group settings by location (e.g. SG, Europe, etc.)<br><b>D – Domain Policy</b>: To deploy GPOs to all users/computers of a domain.<br><b>OU – Organizational Unit</b>: FINAL policy processed. OVERRIDES all other lower settings. Linking to an OU is preferred method to deploy GPOs. Different OUs can be created for different teams/departments."
Basic NTFS permissions,"Full Control, Modify, Read & execute, Read, Write, Special permissions"
Data at Rest Meaning,"Data that is being stored in a storage medium. E.g., employee records in database tables, Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) on a company server."
Data at Rest Security Risks,"Lost / stolen / leaked devices with confidential data, data corruption from human error / unauthorized changes / hardware failure."
Data at Rest Solutions,"Backups and Disaster Recovery (DR), protect against hardware failures and data corruption but not data leaks.<br>File and folder encryption / Volume encryption"
Data in Motion Meaning,"Data being sent over a communication channel. E.g., web pages sent to browsers, files copied to/from network shared folders."
Data in Motion Security Risks,"Man-in-the-middle attacks, data intercepted/modified in transit."
Data in Motion Solutions,"Ensure HTTPS connections (i.e., SSL certificates on servers), Use VPNs, Use secure file transfer (SFTP, FTPS, SCP, etc.) instead of FTP, Using SSH instead of Telnet.`"
Disk Partition,"Divides a storage device into multiple logical storage units (partitions) with dedicated area for paging/swapping and dedicated area for cache & log files. In a typical disk partition setup, a system partition is allocated for the OS, and a data partition is allocated for storing user data.<br>See Disk Partitioning Schemes for types of partitions."
Disk Partition Schemes,"Master Boot Record (MBR) - Max partition size of 2 TB, max of 4 primary partitions, or 3 primary partitions + one extended partition. GUID Partition Table (GPT) - Max partition size of 8 ZB (Zettabytes), max no. of partitions limited by OS (Windows limit is 128), need 64-bit hardware and OS."
Domain Controller (DC) Refresh Policy,See Policy Refresh
Enterprise Patch Management,"Enterprise Patch Management is the process of identifying, acquiring, verifying, and testing, and installing patches for products and systems within an organization."
File System Types,See Types of File Systems
Functions of a File System,"Control how data is stored and retrieved, provided access control (e.g., read/write permissions), provide metadata (e.g., file creation time, time it was last accessed)"
Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration (IE-ESC),"Adjusts IE extensibility & security settings to reduce IT security threats, reduces the functionality of webpages, web-based applications, local network resources, & applications on browsers."
Local System Account (LSA),"Services default to log on as the LSA. LSA gives the service almost unlimited privileges on Windows, like UNIX root account."
net command,"Only has ""net start"" and ""net stop"" commands. Usage: net start/stop ""<service name>"" (e.g. net start ""FileZilla Server"") Netstat commands use synchronous mode, which waits for operation to complete before returning control to user."
Master Boot Partitioning Max Size,2 TB
Maximum size of Single File on NTFS,16 TB
Microsoft Patch Tuesday,Regular patches from Microsoft on the second Tuesday of each month. Worldwide roll-out from Tue 10:00am PST (but not sent out all at once to every computer in the world. Will take a few hours for updates to roll out across the world)
Paging,"For Paging Terminology, see Which statement is true/false for paging?"
Policy Refresh,"Workstations, Member Servers: Every 90min, with a random offset interval up to 30 min.<br>Domain Controllers (DC): Every 5 min"
Principle of Least Privilege (POLP),Minimal level of access that allows normal functioning. Give the lowest level of rights with which users can still do their jobs. Limits potential damage of security breach.
Problems with Patches,"The day after Patch Tuesday, hackers will swoop in with new zero-day exploits. Hackers can also reverse-engineer patches to create new exploits in a matter of days or even hours. Hackers also have an entire month between Patch Tuesdays to exploit the vulnerability."
sc command,"Usage: sc start/stop ""<service name>"" (e.g. sc start ""FileZilla Server"") sc commands use asynchronous mode, which does not wait for the operation to complete before returning control to the user. Could be more efficient if next operation does not depend on the service status."
Security concern with Virtualization,Misconfigured VM due to necessary services are stopped.
Services (Characteristics),"Advanced feature of MS Windows (known earlier as NT services), support mgmnt of long running/background processes and applications (similar to UNIX daemons), can start before any user logs on, ideal for software that needs to start at machine boot (e.g. web/database/app servers), can continue running even after all users log off"
Services (Purpose),"Provide core OS functions like event logging, file serving, printing, time synchronization, etc."
Service Administration,Use net and sc commands (see net command and sc command for more info)
Service Control Manager (SCM),"Service control programs communicate with the Service Control Manager (SCM), which is a special process that starts at sys boot. It starts, stops and interacts with Windows service processes. Located at C:\Windows\System32\services.exe"
Service Control Manager (SCM) purposes,"Maintains/locks/unlocks service database, tracks stats. of installed services, starts services/driver services on sys. startup/upon demand, transmit control requests to running services."
Service Hardening Methods / LSA Alternatives,"<b><u>Local and Network Service</b></u><br>Microsoft has provided 2 additional SIDs for Local Administrators to assign to services:<br><ul><li>Local Service (SID: S-1-5-19) – For services that only access local resources & don't need access to network resources. Actual name: NT AUTHORITY\LocalService.</li><li>Network Service (SID: S-1-5-20) – For services that need access to network resources, accesses network resources using the computer's credentials – similar to LSA. Actual name: NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService. Both Local Service and Network Service don't have a password like LSA.</li></ul><br><b><u>Domain Service Account/Managed Service Account/Virtual Account</b></u><br>Besides Local and Network Service, Windows supports alternative approaches to assigning service accounts with restricted privileges.<br><ul><li>Domain Service Account – Able to centrally manage as a domain account in AD, able to assign specific perms, needs manual/custom password management.</li><li>Managed Service Account – Needs Windows PowerShell to setup, no GUI support for creating and managing MSAs, password auto created for MSA when account is created, refreshed every 30 days. Password can also be changed manually.</li><li>Virtual Account – Need to use sc command to setup, virtual account name is NT SERVICE\<servicename>, automatically generated 240-byte, random password, non-expiring account and cannot be locked out, service logs on as virtual account with same service name, makes auditing easier.</li></ul>"
Service Startup Options,"Automatic: Service starts automatically as part of Windows boot process; Automatic (Delayed Start): Services starts automatically with a delay, to let other services with Automatic start execute first; Manual: Service is off by default but can be started by another app or process that needs it. Once started, will remain on until manually stopped or system reboots. Disabled: Service will not start and cannot be started unless setting is changed."
Service Testing,Unit testing > System Integration Testing (SIT) > On-Site Acceptance Testing (OSAT) > User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Types of File Systems,"Windows: FAT (File Allocation Table) - FAT16/FAT32, exFAT (extended FAT), NTFS (New Technology File System), HFS (Hierarchical File System - can read but can't write)"
Which of the following is NOT an acceptable step to secure an OS?,Enabling dual boot at BIOS setting.
Which of the network modes should be used if you want to ensure that network connections that are initiated from the physical network cannot reach your VM even though your VM can access the physical network?,Network Address Translation (NAT)
Which statement is true/false for paging?,True: Page in means page is transferred from disk to RAM. Page out means page is transferred from RAM to disk. Page Fault = Page Miss. Page Fault / Page Miss means the requested page is not in RAM. Page Hit means the requested page is in RAM.
